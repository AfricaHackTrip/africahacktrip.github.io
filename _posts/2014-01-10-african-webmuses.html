<p>“African WebMuses” presents portraits of women that our team met during a journey in November 2013. We wanted to show powerful females from the IT industry, working as programmers, teachers, tech events organizers and managers supporting technology development. It was a great pleasure to meet and learn from all of you. Martha Chumo, Julliet Zoe Wanyiri, Jessica Colaco, Miriam Wambui, Jamie Mayombwe, Akaliza Keza Gara, Clarisse Iribagiza, Carolyne Ekyarisiima, Fatma Meawad – thank you for being an inspiration!</p>
<p>The movie was made by <a href="http://webmus.es/">WebMuses</a> and AfricaHackTrip, with financial support of <a href="http://www.w4.org/">Women&#8217;s WorldWide Web</a> and <a title="Happy Holidays from WMIAfrica!" href="http://blog.wmiafrica.org/">WMIAfrica</a>. Thank you! Asante!</p>
