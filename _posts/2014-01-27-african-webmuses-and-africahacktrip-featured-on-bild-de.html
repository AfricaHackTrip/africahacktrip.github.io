<p>Today, AfricaHackTrip and especially Emi&#8217;s wonderful <a href="{{ "/2014/01/10/african-webmuses.html" | relative_url }}">African WebMuses</a> movie and four of the protagonists, were featured on the website of BILD Zeitung. Bild is a German tabloid and apparently, the newspaper with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_the_world_by_circulation" target="_blank">sixth-largest circulation</a> worldwide.</p>
<p>Its motto is &#8220;Form your own opinion&#8221;. In order for you all to do exactly that, here is a quick translation of the <a href="http://www.bild.de/geld/wirtschaft/afrika/afrikanische-hacker-prinzessinnen-34316104.bild.html" target="_blank">original article</a>:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Young. Female. Computer Professionals. These are Africa’s Hacker Princesses.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>They are young, female – and can program a PC like a pro! In Africa, ever more young women discover the tech business – and become true hacker princesses.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The video „Africa Web Muses“, <a href="https://africahacktrip.org/">which was produced during the Africa Hack Trip</a>, gives an insight into this scene.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The journey was organized by eight tech professionals from Europe. In Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania, they searched for African hacker spaces – places where computers are being programmed, new websites are being built and IT projects are being pushed. They met many committed women in the tech scene.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>BILD introduces four amazing hacker princesses:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">► <strong>Martha Chumo (19) </strong>from Nairobi had already raised several thousand dollars on the crowdfunding platform “indigogo” to attend „Hacker School New York“ in the USA, where coding is being tought in workshops, amongst other things. But her visa was denied. Reason: Too young, no children, unmarried. Instead of despairing, the tough Kenyan started a new crowdfunding campaign – for an own Hacker School in Nairobi! Her project succeeded: She founded “Nairobi Dev School”.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There, she wants to enhance enthusiasm for tech. Martha: ‘It works better than I thought. I hope it will be a starting point for the development in Africa.’ To further improve her school, she continues raising money on indigogo.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">► <strong>Jessica Colaco </strong>is a founding member of „iHub“, a Coworking and Hacker Space in Nairobi. When she happens to not be programming, she plays the bass guitar and rides horses. Her goal: Put Kenya on the map for tech! To reach it, she organizes Bootcamps and TED events. Jessica: ‘I specifically try to get women to study tech and remain in the field later on.’</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">► <strong>Jamie Mayombwe </strong>from Uganda studies IT and Software Engineering. She helps organizing the “Girl Geek Camp” in Kampala. ‘It started as a meeting, then we shared it on Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus’, Jamie says. More and more girls started attending the female tech bootcamp. Jamie: ‘It’s mostly between 10 and 15 girls. They get a laptop, software, and we show them what to do with it.’</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">► <strong>Akaliza Keza Gara (22)</strong> specifically came to Rwanda to start her own business. Her uncle had advised her to do so, saying that Kigali was the best place to be ‘female, young and technically skilled’. The young woman is now the CEO of “Shaking Sun” in Kigali,a company that produces graphics and internet games. Akaliza is involved with the “Girls ICT Rwanda” association. Together with other women she visits schools and tries to get female students excited about IT jobs. Akaliza: ‘In the past, I found being the only girl in a computer group cool. Nowadays, I hope that this is changing.’</p>
