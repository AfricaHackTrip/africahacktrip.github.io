<p>As you probably know that we have been running a <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/africahacktrip-the-movie/x/1586873">indiegogo campaign</a> the last weeks to raise money to cover the production costs for the upcoming AfricaHackTrip Movie. &#8211; We need to turn the 30h of video material into a nice documentary.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thank you so much for you interest and your support! You are awesome!</strong><br ?><br/>
We have raised nearly 5000 USD. Which helps us a lot to cover for the production costs and we are very excited to get the movie published.<br/> The movie will be released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA license</a> and made available online.<br/> We will keep posting updates about our progress here but do not yet know when we will be done.

For those who can not wait for the movie: have you already seen the <a href="http://vimeo.com/83678627">interviews with some of the amazing women we have met</a>? Or a <a href="https://vimeo.com/95722140">some quotes of Eric Hersman</a>?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wait, what about the perks?</strong><br/>
For all our supporters: Even though we have not reached the campaign goal you for sure will get your stickers, T-Shirts, etc. Just give us a little bit of time to print and send them to you. Let us know if you have any other questions.</p>
