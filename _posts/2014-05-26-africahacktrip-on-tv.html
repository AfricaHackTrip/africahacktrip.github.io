<p>Deutsche Welle TV&#8217;s globalization magazine <a title="Global 3000" href="http://www.dw.de/global-3000-the-globalization-program/p-2767958-9798" target="_blank">Global 3000</a> has produced an episode using some of the material we brought back from the AfricaHackTrip. So some of the African Hackers we met and their projects are being introduced to a wider audience &#8211; w00t w00t!!</p>

<p>Here are the full episodes in <a href="http://www.dw.de/global-3000-the-globalization-program-2014-05-26/e-17620646-9798" target="_blank">English</a> and <a href="http://www.dw.de/global-3000-das-globalisierungsmagazin-2014-05-26/e-17622551-9800" target="_blank">German</a>.</p>
<h3>Watch it on TV</h3>
<p>If you are like me and want to also watch it on TV rather than only on your computer: There are various broadcast times, as the DW program is shown all over the world.</p>
<p>The German version premieres on TV tonight at 22:03 and is repeated five times over the next two days on German TV and again on DW Europe &#8211; check <a title="Global 3000: Ausstrahlungszeiten" href="http://www.dw.de/programm/ausstrahlungszeiten/s-12972-9800" target="_blank">here</a> for more info on that.<br/>
The first broadcast of the English version will be at 21:30 UTC, so 23:30 in Rwanda, 0:30 in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, 14:30 on the Pacific and 17:30 on the Atlantic Coast of America. There are <a title="Global 3000: Broadcast Times" href="http://www.dw.de/program/broadcast-times/s-12998-9798" target="_blank">repeat broadcasts</a> every day of the week in English, German and (I think) French, and there should be subtitled editions in various languages soon.</p>
<p>The clips are also being syndicated, for example to German economic newspaper <a title="Afrikas Hacker: Von null auf 100 in vier Jahren" href="http://www.handelsblatt.com/video/global-3000/boom-in-ostafrika-afrikas-hacker-von-null-auf-100-in-vier-jahren/9948746.html" target="_blank">Handelsblatt</a>.</p>
