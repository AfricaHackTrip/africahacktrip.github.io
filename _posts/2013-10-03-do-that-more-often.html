<p>The first week lies behind us, and we are really overwhelmed what a success the barcamp and hackathon has been. One thing we saw in the participants&#8217; feedback is that they liked the format and that they want us to do such events more often.</p>
<p>Asking for this is a great compliment and a good indicator that we did everything right. But as we from the AfricaHackTrip are seeing our goal in establishing connections between Africa and Europe, we encourage the local community to do those events on their own.</p>
<p>So here is our call: Organize barcamps and hackathons, build user groups and exchange experience. We would love to see that!</p>
