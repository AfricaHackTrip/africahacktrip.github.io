<p>We are shocked and deeply sorry about what happened and still happens in Nairobi. We&#8217;d like to send our sincere condolences to those who lost their loved ones, and wish everyone who was injured a quick recovery.</p>
<p>Gregor is already in the city since a few days and was even in the Westgate area when the attacks started. Fortunately, he&#8217;s alright and he already donated blood.</p>
<p>Our trip will officially start in three days (25 Sep) in Nairobi and our plans haven&#8217;t changed. We are worried and we take things seriously but we are still very excited to finally be there. Let&#8217;s kick off more collaboration!</p>
