<p><strong>Today is a big day for us: <a title="AfricaHackTrip: The Movie" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/africahacktrip-the-movie#home">We just launched the crowdfunding campaign for our movie on Indiegogo!!</a> W00t w00t!! </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We returned from Africa with awesome new friends, lots of stories to tell, thousands of pictures, and 30 hours of video footage. We want to turn this footage into a great movie, so we can share our experiences with communities all over the world and motivate others to join the exchange between cultures. To do this, we need time and professional support.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where YOU come in! Please help us raise $7,000 to cover our production costs, so we can introduce you to exciting places and awesome people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be a part of AfricaHackTrip! Show us and the world that you love the idea of truly connecting hacker cultures!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In return, we signify our love and gratitude to you by <strong>mentioning every single backer</strong> in the credits of our movie. Yes, even if you donate just a dollar, we will thank you in the credits. But we also prepared some perks for those that give us more money &#8211; go check them all out <a title="AfricaHackTrip: The Movie" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/africahacktrip-the-movie">here</a>!</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">We are very grateful for the experience AfricaHackTrip was for us. We met incredible people, learned about crazy cool projects, found out how Africans use  technology to solve social problems, and brought together European and African hacking culture. And most importantly we kicked off continuous exchange â€“ like with our friends over at <a title="Nairobi Dev School" href="http://nairobidevschool.org/" target="_blank">Nairobi Dev School</a> and <a title="EuroHackTrip" href="http://www.eurohacktrip.org/" target="_blank">EuroHackTrip</a>. Please help us tell you all about it!</span></p>
<p><strong>Thank you all for your support!!!</strong></p>
<p>HighFives, Hugs and lots of &lt;3 from<br/>
Gregor, Alex, Emi, Bumi, Basti, Martin, Vicy, Jan and Tobi</p>
