  <p>
    <strong>We are a group of developers and designers from Europe. When we heard about the emerging African tech hubs we decided to take a trip to connect and exchange with local communities.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We met incredible people, shared ideas and experiences and built things together. We learned about cool projects and unique challenges, visited amazing spaces, and - most importantly - made friends.

    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>
      We had been <strong>working with people from all over the world</strong>, but <strong>not yet with hackers from Africa</strong>. We were curious and wanted to change that.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also wanted to share our experiences with our local communities and kick off a continuous exchange.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>How</h2>
    <p>
      We went as self-funded individuals in order to meet <strong>at eye-level</strong> and organized <strong>barcamps and hackathons</strong> to get in touch with as many people as possible.
    </p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>When/Where</h2>
    <p>
      In 2013 we went to East Africa and spent a week each in <strong>Nairobi</strong> (Kenya), <strong>Kampala</strong> (Uganda), <strong>Kigali</strong> (Rwanda) and <strong>Dar es Salaam</strong> (Tanzania) and visited the main tech hubs there.
