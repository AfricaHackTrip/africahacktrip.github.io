    We are a group of developers &amp; designers from Europe, curious about the emerging African tech hubs.
  </h1>
  <p>
    From September 23rd to November 1st 2013 we have been exploring the East African tech szene.
    Our goal was to document our experience and to kick off a continuous exchange between the continents.

    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.4"><strong>Since submarine fibre-optic cables connect East Africa to fast, reliable and affordable Internet, the regions tech scene has been leapfrogging: from no net to mobile net in 4 years.</strong></p>
    <p>We have been working with people from all over the world, but not yet with hackers from Africa. We believe that it takes personal contacts to establish lasting networks. So we decided to just go there. We have met, connected with our peers, brought together European and African hacking culture, and &#8211; most important &#8211; have kicked off a continuous exchange. </p>
    <p>To bring back our experience and to motivate more people joining the exchange between the continents we have documented the trip in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/africahacktrip">pictures</a> and videos.</p>
